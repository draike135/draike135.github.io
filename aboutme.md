### My story

In these projects i was lead responsable for 3D modeling in most of them, others i was responsable for programming and also some 2D art. Due to my background in engenniring and arts i was usualy the bridge betweeen programers and artists.

Around the time i entered University in Lisbon i also started looking for a part time job, im from Vila Real and beeing displaced student cost of living is extremely high, i found a position teaching programming classes in a private school SHARKCODERS, and later i manage to also teach game development in st.Julians internachional school under Madfox company.
