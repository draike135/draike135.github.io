In this post i go in more detail in the projects i have been apart of, whyle i was a member of student group GameDevTecnico.
Full credit for the games are avalable at the games page at itch.io, linked in itch game i´ll present.

**Most of these games were developed during game jams, a few are internal projects**

## 3D games

This is the most ambicios project im apart of, for the past 3 years we have been developing this idea of an hight quality game around Huge Bastions and an awesom character story. In this game i have been responsable for heliping in concep art, and latter deveoping the models for the huge bastions the player can explore.


[Here]([https://deanattali.com/](https://antunes10.itch.io/winds-of-berkana)) i have made avalable all art and models i can share.

Final quackdown was one of the best games i ever did in a  Gamejams, Nordic game jam 2022 is a staple in international game jam´s, i had the plesure to be selected by GameDevTecnico to go as a member of 2 teams to represent our university in this competition.
Here we were presented with the opportunity to make a game with the main sponcer of the event LEGO, we had to encorporate lego elements in our game, we also had a few restrictions as we decided to stick with the jams thematic!
The final product is a local Multiplayer game that involves a controller and a map made of lego!

### [Anglership](https://ratuspro.itch.io/anglership)

Now for the first game jam i ever participated, anglership, still one of my proudest work, i had the luck to be serrounded by a tallented team full of veterans that helped me and guided me trought my first team project.
In this project i learned about repos, gitkraken, and a bunch of other stuff.
The thematic of the jam was Black & Whyte, where we could only use these 2 shades. i was incharge of modeling all 3D assets in the game.
In the end with the shadders the final product was vety well recived we placed 32 out of 200 in the visual and ambient part of the competition!

### [Chocolate in Time](https://nomig.itch.io/choco-time)

Chocolate in time was my second game, it was a chalange because we had both an 3D artist and a 2D artist, but we wanted to make a plataformer puzzle game, we got midle term in a 2.5D puzzle game that i simply love.
This and anglership is still one of the games i alwys put my students playing and i download form time to time to play on my own.

### [Under Pressure](https://antunes10.itch.io/under-pressure)

![SwtUNC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dca3c598-8b6e-42fd-ad54-5bb8f25e2037)

Another big internatinal game jam is Global game jam, since my first year of university i made a promisse to myselft that i would participate in evry years global game jam. this was also a first for me because we were participating in a internacional site remotly, it was amazing. Because of the 48h duration of the jam we were worcking full time and the jam site organizers were horried about us. This Terror game was a blast to do and i was incharge of evry single asset as the led artist. i also did some code for the game.

### [Bombers](https://draike.itch.io/bomb)

![YsWj0z](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42b574b9-5821-4e5e-91ec-db156a13f66c)

Bombers was the first game i lead in programing and 3D art, i was responceble to make both minigames worck on the main scene and was for the last 4 days of the game jam. it was a very interesting game to make, the gameplay could only be 20s long we had alot of inpiration from Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.

### [Alive](https://darkqueensara.itch.io/alive)

![Rnkygw](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fab84a7-24a9-47d7-9429-d99d7343dde0)

DOOM, do you like DOOM? because one of my team members sure did like doom, i have miz feelings about this projects, i had great ambition for redesinnig doom and i worcked around with some real nice blood and gore textures that i made myself, but in the end due to pressure from a member of our team we went back to classic wall textures and desing.
This made my worck farely simple and i just designed the map + some assets, this was also mey 1st game in Unreal Engine.

## 2D

### [monstrum-umbra](https://nunobaptista57.itch.io/monstrum-umbra)

![alLcHH](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72549bab-835a-45a6-8dfb-1476b9849acd)

Another 2D game, this i had to experement with 2D art, not my spciality but i was incharge of desing all UI elements + help program ui and menus. The thematic of the jam was 2 bit so we could only use 2 colors, i loved working on this game because i was full out of the box, but its one of my favorite games and i also pop this one out once in a whyle to play
